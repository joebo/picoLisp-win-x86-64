         Ersatz PicoLisp
         ===============

Ersatz PicoLisp is a version of PicoLisp completely written in Java. It requires
a 1.6 Java Runtime Environment.

It should be the last resort when there is no other way to run a "real"
PicoLisp. Also, it may be used to bootstrap the 64-bit version, which requires a
running PicoLisp to build from the sources.

Unfortunately, ErsatzLisp lacks everything which makes up "true" PicoLisp:
Speed, small memory footprint, and simple internal structures.

Performance is rather poor. It is 5 to 10 times slower, allocates a huge amount
of memory at startup (600 MB vs. 3 MB), and needs 2.5 to 4 times the space for
runtime Lisp data. But efficiency was not a major goal. Instead, performance was
often sacrificed in favor of simpler or more modular structures.

There is no support for

-- raw console input ('key') and line editing
-- child processes ('fork')
-- interprocess communication ('tell', 'hear', 'ipc', 'udp' etc.)
-- databases (external symbols)
-- signal handling


      Invocation
      ----------

Ersatz PicoLisp can be started - analog to 'pil' - as

   $ ersatz/pil

This includes slightly simplified versions of the standard libraries as loaded
by the "real" 'pil' (without database, but with Pilog and XML support).

To start it in debug mode, use

   $ ersatz/pil +


On non-Unix systems, you might start 'java' directly, e.g.:

   java -DPID=42 -cp .;tmp;picolisp.jar PicoLisp lib.l

Instead of '42' some other number may be passed. It is used to simulate a
"process ID", so it should be different for every running instance of Ersatz
PicoLisp.


      Building the JAR file
      ---------------------

The actual source files are

   sys.src  # The system
   fun.src  # Function definitions

The PicoLisp script "mkJar" will read them, generate the Java source file
"PicoLisp.java", compile that with 'javac', and pack the result into a JAR (Java
Archive) file. "mkJar" expects to be run in the "ersatz/" directory, e.g.:

   $ (cd ersatz; ./mkJar)
